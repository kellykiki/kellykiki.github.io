                Since Broadway has already been running into the new 53-weeks season, let's have a look at the industry's grosses during the very first weeks of the 2018-2019 season and make some comparisons to the previous months statistics. Focus is on last week grosses (July 23 - July 29) compared to the box office results for the previous seven-days period, from July 16 to July 22; seasonal analysis follows taking into account data from November 2017 to June 2018.

               It doesn’t matter that Walter Kerr Theater capacity is the smallest one amongst 31 theaters in Broadway. Bruce Springsteen's historic sold-out performances continued and his one man show hit 509$ average ticket price, while average ticket to Hamilton reached 293$. Both of the shows sold the weekly top-tickets; one-dollar difference made Springsteen on Broadway be listed first among top-sellers with the most expensive ticket sold for 850$. Hamilton gross amounts to 3.14M $, but Bruce Springsteen's performance increases grosses by 1M $, bringing 1.93M $ to the Walter Kerr box office instead of 964K $ that the show succeded the previous week. The Waitress increased amount of seats sold out of the total seats available by 10%, while the Bronx Tale continued increase sales rate at its closing week.

                From November 2017 to June 2018, Broadway records attendance of 9.9M tickets sold and grosses of 1.13B $. So, it is not just high attendance that is driving Broadway’s success; it is high prices. The Book of Mormon, which was constantly sold out, grossed 1.2M $ on weekly average, while Hamilton’s average weekly gross was 3.1M $, followed by The Lion King and Springsteen on Broadway with 2.2M $ average weekly gross for each. That means that Richard Rodgers, Minskoff and Walter Kerr theatres grosses amount to 111M $, 78M $ and 65M $ respectively in seasonal total. The Home for the Holidays seems to be this year Broadway’s loser, as it records the lowest attendance rate and average weekly gross of less than 70K $.
