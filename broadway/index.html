                Since Broadway has already been running into the new 53-weeks season, let's have a look at the industry's grosses during the very first weeks of the 2018-2019 season and make some comparisons to the previous months statistics. Focus is on last week grosses (July 23 - July 29) compared to the box office results for the previous seven-days period, from July 16 to July 22; seasonal analysis follows taking into account data from November 2017 to June 2018.

               It doesnâ€™t matter that Walter Kerr Theater capacity is the smallest one amongst 31 theaters in Broadway. Bruce Springsteen's historic sold-out performances continued and his one man show hit 509$ average ticket price, while average ticket to Hamilton reached 293$. Both of the shows sold the weekly top-tickets; one-dollar difference made Springsteen on Broadway be listed first among top-sellers with the most expensive ticket sold for 850$. Hamilton gross amounts to 3.14M $, but Bruce Springsteen's performance increases grosses by 1M $, bringing 1.93M $ to the Walter Kerr box office instead of 964K $ that the show succeded the previous week. The Waitress increased amount of seats sold out of the total seats available by 10%, while the Bronx Tale continued increase sales rate at its closing week.

                From November 2017 to June 2018, Broadway records attendance of 9.9M tickets sold and grosses of 1.13B $. So, it is not just high attendance that is driving Broadwayâ€™s success; it is high prices. The Book of Mormon, which was constantly sold out, grossed 1.2M $ on weekly average, while Hamiltonâ€™s average weekly gross was 3.1M $, followed by The Lion King and Springsteen on Broadway with 2.2M $ average weekly gross for each. That means that Richard Rodgers, Minskoff and Walter Kerr theatres grosses amount to 111M $, 78M $ and 65M $ respectively in seasonal total. The Home for the Holidays seems to be this year Broadwayâ€™s loser, as it records the lowest attendance rate and average weekly gross of less than 70K $.
